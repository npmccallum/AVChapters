# Welcome to AVChapters!

AVChapters is a swift package for managing chapter metadata in QuickTime files
on AVFoundation. I created this package because there is a lot of bad
information about how to create chapters in video files. So this simple library
lets you read and write the metadata trivially. It also serves as a simple
example for others who want to customize it.
